cant

Ant RISC, with a few minor differences, in C.
Goals

    * Write an assembler that can create binary files from ant sources.
    * Write a VM that can interpret the binary files.

Notes

    * This implementation departs in a few ways from the original.
          o This implementation does not use any source provided from Harvard (Iâ€™m not in the class, and it was 10 years ago anyway :P).
          o Assembler/VM write/read binary files rather than text files.
          o There are also probably some unintentional differences too.
